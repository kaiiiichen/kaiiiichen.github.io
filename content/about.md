I am **Kai Chen**, an undergraduate student in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics at the
Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech) in Shenzhen, China, enrolled in the *Fields Honors Program*.

I experienced serious mathematical trainings in understanding abstract concepts and writing proofs, including being exposed to some practical numerical methods. You could see coursework I did in my notes project [SUSTech-Kai-Notes](https://github.com/kaiiiichen/SUSTech-Kai-Notes/wiki). I also have two notes typed in LaTeX in progress (close to the end), which are compatible with real-world courses and thus could be used as well-organized lecture notes. You can check them in the [notes](https://kai-chen.xyz/notes/) section.

I'm currently interested in formalizing mathematical proofs using programming languages and how can reinforcement learning models utilize such tools to write rigorous proofs in mathematics.

Also, I'm keen on cognitive sciences, which I believe is the most important thing us humans should do and make clear before we are really capable of making artificial general intelligence which is actually another form of life.

Moreover, I also like developing small interesting things. You can check a hacker-themed Sodoku game (ios platform) I made here: [SudoSodoku](https://kai-chen.xyz/projects/sudosodoku/).

I will be a visiting undergraduate student at the University of California, Berkeley from January to May 2026, where I plan to further explore advanced mathematics, machine learning, and cognitive science.

- We update using GitHub Actions to automatically run actions on the page and print the result here.
- Remember that you can study overnight in some libraries.
- For overnight information, visit [https://www.lib.berkeley.edu/hours](https://www.lib.berkeley.edu/hours) and pay attention that they are displayed in the form like '8 a.m. - 6 a.m.', which means it opens till 6 a.m. next morning.
- These kinds of information are listed in the details of a library's opening hours details and you need to click on the library to see them, which also makes Python Web Scraper a bit complex to do (so this feature is not integrated here :D).

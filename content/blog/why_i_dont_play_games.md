summary: "A Personal Note on Emotions, Causality, and System Fit"
---

I don’t play video games for a very simple and honest reason:  
I’m not particularly good at them, and in competitive games I often end up tilted, frustrated, and emotionally drained—sometimes even upset for a long time because of mistakes made by teammates.

This isn’t a vague statement like “games just aren’t for me.”  
It’s the result of deliberately observing my own reactions. Once I started taking those reactions seriously, I realized the issue wasn’t *games*, and it wasn’t *me* either. It was a mismatch between a person and a system.

What follows are three conclusions I wrote down for myself—a record I want to be able to return to in the future.

## 1. Tilt Is Not a Personality Flaw, but Nervous-System Overload in a High-Noise Environment

Competitive games are a very specific kind of environment:  
feedback is immediate, punishment is instant, mistakes are irreversible, and everything happens in public view.

In such systems, the brain is forced into a constant loop of stress → correction → stress again.  
If you are highly sensitive to feedback and errors, this loop quickly exhausts your mental resources.

“Tilting” is therefore not a failure of self-control or emotional maturity.  
It is better understood as a **natural response of the nervous system under sustained high load**.

When a system offers almost no room to pause, reflect, or recover, emotional breakdown is not surprising. What *is* surprising is how normalized it has become to expect calmness in such conditions.

## 2. Anger at Teammates Comes from a Higher Demand for Causality Than the System Can Offer

When I get angry at teammates for obvious mistakes, it’s not because I’m harsh or unforgiving.  
It’s because I carry a default model of how the world should work:

> Judgment → Action → Consequence  
> Effort → Improvement → Reward

This is a model built on continuity, explainability, and responsibility.

Most multiplayer competitive games, however, operate on a very different logic:  
individual effort is diluted, mistakes are distributed across the team, and outcomes are heavily influenced by randomness.  
You can do many things right and still lose; others can do many things wrong without bearing the full cost.

For some people, this causal distortion is simply “part of the game.”  
For those who care deeply about logical consistency, it creates a deep sense of friction.

The anger is rarely about a specific teammate.  
It is a reaction to a system that feels **fundamentally unfair while demanding full engagement**.

## 3. Playing Poorly Is Not About Skill, but About Taking the System Too Seriously

I am not someone who can “just play casually.”  
Once I enter a system, I instinctively want to understand its rules, optimize my decisions, and avoid unnecessary mistakes.

The problem is that many games derive their enjoyment from *partial disengagement*:  
being emotionally loose about outcomes, forgiving of errors, and lighthearted about absurdity.

But once I commit seriously, I start to care;  
once I care, the system’s inconsistencies become amplified;  
once amplified, enjoyment collapses.

This creates a paradox:  
the more seriously I take the game, the less suitable it becomes for me.  
Yet without seriousness, I can’t truly engage at all.

This is not about being “unable to lose.”  
It’s about treating a system as worthy of seriousness when it cannot reciprocate with meaningful causality.

## 4. The Real Conclusion: I Am Not Unsuitable for Joy, Only for Certain Joy Mechanisms

There is no universal form of entertainment that fits everyone.  
Different kinds of enjoyment place very different demands on the nervous system and value structure.

Some forms of pleasure are built on:  
high stimulation, strong feedback, low control, and instant resolution.

Others are built on:  
low noise, replayability, clear causality, and accumulative growth.

I clearly belong to the latter.

When I spend time thinking deeply about a problem, slowly building a model, or writing something precise and coherent, the satisfaction I feel is not the thrill of “winning.”  
It is the quiet realization that **I understand something a little better than before**.

This kind of pleasure is slower and quieter—but it does not turn against you.

## 5. A Note to My Future Self

If, someday, I start doubting myself again:  
Am I too serious?  
Too sensitive?  
Too easily affected?

I want to remember this:

**I am not fragile. I am simply honest about how systems affect me.**  
I don’t need to adapt to every environment, and I don’t need to feel ashamed for avoiding certain mechanisms.

Saving my attention and emotional energy for systems that respect causality, allow thought, and reward sincerity  
is not avoidance of the world—it is choosing the part of the world that fits me.

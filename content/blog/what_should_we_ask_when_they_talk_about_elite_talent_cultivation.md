# 当他们谈论“拔尖人才培养”时，我们应该问什么？ What Should We Ask When They Talk About “Elite Talent Cultivation”?

## 引言 Introduction

高考结束了，马上开始招生季，到时候肯定会有人大谈特谈各种“拔尖人才培养”项目，或者其他听起来类似的东西。如果你是考生或者考生家长，听到这种东西时就要小心了，因为里面可能有无数的坑等着你。我从很小的时候就开始参与这种研究项目了（主要角色是被人研究），所以对这类东西颇有一些经验，今天在这儿跟大家分享一下，谈谈面对这种侃侃而谈者，我们可以问的问题都有哪些。

The college entrance exam has ended, and the admissions season is about to begin. During this period, people will surely talk extensively about various “elite talent cultivation” programs or other things that sound similar. If you are an examinee or a parent of an examinee, you should be cautious when hearing about these things, because there could be countless pitfalls waiting for you. I have been involved in these kinds of research programs since I was very young (mainly as someone who was being researched), so I have some experience with these things. Today I’d like to share with you what kinds of questions we can ask when facing people who speak at length about these programs.

先叠个甲：以下内容不针对任一具体项目。

First, let me make it clear: the content below is not targeted at any specific program.

## 这是什么样项目？ What Kind of Program Is This?

有些项目关注基础研究，这类项目可以考虑。目前全世界都存在的问题就是基础学科出路不好，但对一个国家来说这东西不能没有，所以国家有政策支持和财政支持，各级政府和大专院校至少也都在口头上支持。但是要注意，这种项目是真搞还是假搞？比如它是不是拿到了国家的相应项目，享不享受相应的优惠政策，从上面拿到多少财政支持，学校又匹配了多少经费，这些钱有多少真正用在了学生身上，这些问题都值得考虑。

Some programs focus on basic research. These programs can be considered. The current global problem is that basic academic disciplines don’t have good career prospects, but for a country, they are indispensable. That’s why there is national policy support and financial backing, and governments at all levels as well as colleges and universities at least verbally support them. But pay attention: is such a program genuinely doing real work or just pretending? For example, has it really secured the relevant national-level project approval and the associated preferential policies? How much financial support has it received from above, how much funding has the school matched, and how much of this money is genuinely spent on students? These are all questions worth considering.

有些项目鼓吹通识教育，这样的项目只能加重学生学习负担、拖累学生求学进度，对学生毫无意义。这类项目的唯一作用就是让项目的真正推动者念头通达，运气好的话还能发几篇论文、报个教育部奖项什么的。总之，一定要远离。

Some programs promote general education. These kinds of programs only increase students’ study burdens and slow down their academic progress, and they are meaningless to students. The sole purpose of such programs is to fulfill the ambitions of the program’s real promoters, and if they are lucky, maybe publish a few papers or win some awards from the Ministry of Education. In short, stay away.

有些项目鼓吹学科交叉，这里关注的重点是谁和谁交叉？如果是俩难兄难弟，那无所谓，反正大家都不感兴趣。但是如果鼓吹的是某热门专业和冷门专业的交叉，那大概率是冷门专业想靠这个骗高分考生的。总之，快跑。

Some programs advocate interdisciplinary studies. The key point here is: which disciplines are crossing? If it’s two equally struggling fields, it doesn’t matter much — no one is interested anyway. But if it’s trying to pair a popular major with an unpopular one, it’s very likely that the unpopular major is trying to lure high-scoring examinees. In short, run away.

## 为什么要搞这个项目？  Why Is This Program Being Set Up?

有些项目是有大佬提议，上级支持，然后小弟们负责运行。这种项目可以参加，不过要注意有时候他们太想拿出成绩，所以可能会用力过猛，遇到这种情况该怎么应对一会儿再说。

Some programs are proposed by big shots, supported by higher authorities, and run by subordinates. These programs can be joined, but be mindful that sometimes they want to show results too badly and may overdo it. How to deal with that situation will be discussed later.

有些项目属于上面发文，下面响应，主要目的是给上面一个交待，顺便分点钱，这种项目可以参加，而且可能过得比前一种还安逸。

Some programs are issued from above and just responded to by lower levels, mainly to justify to above and to distribute a bit of money on the side. These programs can be joined, and life in them may even be more comfortable than in the first type.

有些项目既没有大佬背书，又没有上级支持，完全就是个别老师想搞事，领导想摘桃，但是要政策没政策、要钱没钱，那就得离它远点了。

Some programs have neither big-shot backing nor higher-level support. They are purely initiatives by individual teachers, with leaders hoping to take credit — but there’s no policy support and no money. Such programs should be avoided.

## 这个项目是什么时候开始有的？ When Did This Program First Start?

如果是第一次搞，别的问题就不用问了，直接跑就行。这种第一年的拔尖人才培养一定会揠苗助长，一整个班能存活一两个强者就算不错，其他人全是炮灰，而且是那种换个环境都不一定能缓过来的炮灰，死得透透的。

If this is the first time the program is being run, you don’t need to ask other questions — just run away immediately. In the first year of elite talent cultivation, the tendency is always to try to force growth. If only one or two strong students survive out of the whole class, that’s considered success — the rest are cannon fodder who may not recover even if placed in a different environment.

如果是搞了两三年了，那好，把前几届同学的成绩单给我看看，别只给好的，我全都要，原因参考上一段。如果大部分人成绩还行，那么这个项目靠谱，可以进；如果大部分人的成绩都惨不忍睹，那请问你们做了哪些改进措施？效果如何？

If the program has been running for two or three years, then show me the transcripts of the previous students. Don’t only show the good ones — I want all of them, for the reason mentioned above. If the majority of people have decent results, then the program is reliable and you can join. If most people’s results are miserable, then what improvements have been made? How effective are they?

如果搞了很多年了，那历年毕业生的出路如何？还是别只给好的，全都要。重点关注每一届入学多少人、毕业多少人，没按时毕业的人是怎么回事？如果是淘汰到其他地方去了，那这种项目就不是为了培养人的，只是为了选拔。如果是为了选拔，那么学生就不是人，只是待选拔的材料而已，这种项目你敢进吗？如果是学生自己主动转出的，那他们的出路和后续境况如何？不同院系的培养方案如何兼容？如果是延毕的，他们未来的出路如何？能顺利拿到双证吗？还能推研和出国吗？

If it has been running for many years, then look at the career paths of graduates. Again, don’t only show the good ones — I want all of them. Focus on how many people enrolled versus how many graduated each year. For those who didn’t graduate on time, what happened? If they were eliminated and sent elsewhere, then this program isn’t for cultivating people — it’s just for selecting them. If it’s just selection, then students aren’t people — they’re merely materials for selection. Would you dare to join such a program? If students voluntarily transferred out, what were their later opportunities and circumstances? How compatible are the cultivation plans in different departments? For those who extended their study period, what are their future prospects? Can they still get their degrees normally? Can they go on to graduate school or study abroad?

## 这个项目是挂靠在哪个院系的？ Which Department Is This Program Affiliated With?

为什么一个主打数学、物理基础学科的项目挂靠在物理系下面，而且没有数学系的人参与？

Why is a program focused on fundamental disciplines in mathematics and physics attached to the physics department, without any involvement from the math department?

为什么一个主打基础学科的项目有一堆工科院系掺和进来了？

Why are a bunch of engineering departments involved in a program that claims to be about basic academic disciplines?

为什么一个鼓吹通识教育的项目只有人文社科的人在？

Why does a program that promotes general education have only humanities and social sciences people involved?

如果你面对的项目给你带来上面这种错位感，那么其中必有猫腻。

If the program you are facing gives you this kind of sense of mismatch, then there must be something fishy.

## 这个项目是谁在执行的？ Who Is Running This Program?

提出者、主要推动者前面说了，无非是大佬、小弟、院系领导、学校领导或者个别老师几种情况。接下来应该关注的是，授课教师是谁？班主任、辅导员、教务、学生事务等又是谁？

We’ve talked about the proposer and the main promoters — big shots, subordinates, department leaders, school leaders, or individual teachers. Next, pay attention to: who are the instructors? Who are the homeroom teachers, counselors, academic affairs administrators, and student affairs staff?

如果授课老师都是业内大佬，虽然业内大佬未必上课就好，但至少说明这个项目的主持者肯投入、有面子，前途不会太差。如果授课老师跟不拔尖的专业一样，那至少无功无过，应该不会有啥风险。但是，如果授课老师都是国外回来的小年轻，学术成果一堆，教学经验几乎为零，那就得掂量掂量了。

If the instructors are all industry experts, even though experts aren’t necessarily good teachers, at least it shows the program leaders are willing to invest and have some face — and the prospects won’t be too bad. If the instructors are similar to those in non-elite majors, then at least there’s no risk — it should be neutral. But if all the instructors are young researchers back from abroad with a lot of academic achievements and almost no teaching experience, then you have to think twice.

另外，班主任、辅导员等教学管理者也很重要。教学管理实际上是非常复杂的一项事务，必须得有一定的专业能力和经验才能胜任，另外直接面向学生的人还得有强烈的责任心、共情能力和处理复杂局面的能力。如果只是会吹牛逼、会拍马屁的人担任这些角色，那这个项目的参与者大概率不会获得幸福。

Additionally, homeroom teachers and counselors are also important. Student management is actually a very complex task that requires professional ability and experience to handle. Those who directly interact with students must also have strong responsibility, empathy, and the ability to deal with complex situations. If these roles are filled by people who just know how to brag or flatter, then participants in the program are unlikely to find happiness.

## 这个项目的培养方案有什么创新？ What Innovations Are in the Program’s Training Plan?

先拿一份不拔尖的培养方案，新老对比着看。如果整体没什么变化，或者只是增加了一两门用来证明自己确有创新点的课，那就应该没什么风险，可以进。如果新培养方案总学分要求增加了，或者多了一堆看名字就很不友好的课，那还是先看看往届学生的毕业出路和成绩单吧。

Take a look at a non-elite program’s training plan and compare it with the new one. If there’s no significant overall change, or just one or two courses added to prove innovation, then it’s probably not risky — you can join. If the total credit requirement has increased, or there are a bunch of courses with unfriendly-sounding titles, then first look at the graduation outcomes and transcripts of past students.

如果对方鼓吹全英文授课，那么也可以直接跑路。事实上，全英文授课对教学效果没有丝毫的提升作用，全是反效果。大学开设全英文课的原因无外乎两条：有学生听不懂中文；有老师讲不了中文。所以如果有人要开全英文课，那要么是学生不行，要么是老师不行，当然也可能是领导不行，反正这不是什么值得吹嘘的优点。

If the other side boasts “all-English instruction,” then you can run away immediately. In fact, teaching entirely in English doesn’t improve educational outcomes — it only has negative effects. Universities offer all-English courses for only two reasons: either students can’t understand Chinese, or teachers can’t speak Chinese. So if someone insists on all-English instruction, either the students aren’t capable, or the teachers aren’t — and perhaps the leaders aren’t either. In any case, this is not something worth boasting about.

## 这个项目的出入机制如何？ What Are the Entry and Exit Mechanisms of This Program?

这个项目是实体班级还是贴标签式的虚拟班级？如果是虚拟班级，那么各种统计数据肯定贼好看，但那是选拔的结果，不是培养的结果。

Is this program an actual class, or is it just a label attached conceptually? If it’s a virtual label class, then all the statistical data will look great — but that result reflects selection, not actual cultivation.

转系阶段能否进出？条件是什么？过去案例的来源和去向的统计数据看看？推研阶段能否进出？条件？数据？

Can students transfer into or out of the program? What are the conditions? Look at the historical data for transfer cases and outcomes. What about conditions and data for transfers during postgraduate recommendation stages?

如何看待成绩差的同学？是淘汰到其他地方？还是降低毕业要求、准许其体面离开？

How do they treat students with poor grades? Are they eliminated and sent elsewhere, or do they just lower graduation requirements to let them leave gracefully?

推研的政策如何？往年去向的数据如何？往届学生入学时的承诺兑现了多少？出国情况如何？

What are the policies for postgraduate recommendation? How have previous students fared? When previous students enrolled, how many of the program’s promises were fulfilled? What about studying abroad?

是否允许双学位或者辅修？条件？数据？

Is dual-degree or minor study allowed? What are the conditions? How does the data look?

## 这个项目的参与者们的心理健康状况如何？ What About the Mental Health of Participants?

在项目筹备阶段有没有就课程设置、学籍管理等问题咨询过大学生心理健康方面的专业人士？

During the program’s planning stage, were student mental health professionals consulted regarding curriculum design and student status management?

管理者中有没有负责心理健康的？有没有具备专业知识或者至少接受过一定培训的？跟专业机构有没有专人对接？

Is there someone responsible for mental health among the administrators? Do they have professional knowledge or at least basic training? Is there a dedicated contact with professional institutions?

对学生心理健康情况的监测、预警、干预机制如何？过去有没有干预过的案例，最后结果如何？过去的学生有没有那啥的？

What are the mechanisms for monitoring, early warning, and intervention for student mental health? Have there been intervention cases in the past, and what were the outcomes? Were there past students who had serious issues?

## 最后，如果误入一个喜欢揠苗助长的项目怎么办？ Finally, What If You End Up in a Program That Likes to Force Growth?

首先，政策制定者不是上帝，所以，他是错的，你是对的。

First, policymakers are not gods — they can be wrong, and you can be right.

其次，你觉得难学的东西你的同学也一定有同感，大家要建立统一战线。

Second, if you feel the material is hard to learn, your classmates probably feel the same. You should build a united front.

接下来，先和任课老师沟通，让他充分理解课程体系设计上的缺陷，了解同学们遇到的困境，然后进行有针对性的调整。

Next, communicate with instructors, let them fully understand the design flaws in the curriculum and the difficulties students are facing, and then make targeted adjustments.

然后，和教学管理者沟通，让他们充分理解学生在学习、生活和心理上面临的困境，如果所有人都不希望出事，那就总有回旋的余地。

Then, talk with the student affairs administrators, help them understand the academic, life, and psychological challenges students face — if nobody wants things to go wrong, there will be room for compromise.

最后，和政策制定者沟通，摆事实、讲道理，用数据说话，让其明白自己的政策制定得确有问题，最后，尊重客观规律，让教学回归正轨。

Finally, talk with the policymakers, present facts and reason with data, make them understand that their policy has real problems, and ultimately, respect objective reality and let education return to the right track.

## 结语 Conclusion

其实，在我看来，真正的拔尖人才都不是靠老师教出来的，而是学生们自己学出来的。面对这样的学生，教育者们唯一该做的就是营造宽松的环境，然后任其自由生长。教育者们真正应该关心的是学生群体中处于中后段的学生，让这些学生能够顺利毕业会对他们的人生产生重大的积极影响，而这种影响也会扩散到全社会，让我们的整个世界变好。教育的目的不外如此。

In my view, truly outstanding talent isn’t cultivated by teachers — it’s cultivated by the students themselves. For such students, the only thing educators should do is create a relaxed environment and let them grow freely. What educators truly need to care about are the students in the middle and lower segments — helping them graduate successfully will have a significant positive impact on their lives, and this impact will spread to society and make our world better. That is the purpose of education.

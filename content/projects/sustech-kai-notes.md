Launched in 2025, [SUSTech-Kai-Notes](https://github.com/kaiiiichen/SUSTech-Kai-Notes) is a personal notes initiative motivated by [Cambridge Notes](https://dec41.user.srcf.net/notes/). However, one should also lay emphasis on other course resources apart from course notes.

It mainly includes the course resources I ever used or collected during my study at [SUSTech](https://www.sustech.edu.cn) and also includes few courses I took at other universities, which are mostly for general study credits but worth giving it a try.

I accompany this special notes project with a Github wiki page, which reviews the project and helps you get directed to submodules within clicks.

[{"content":" We update using GitHub Actions to automatically run actions on the page and print the result here. Remember that you can study overnight in some libraries. For overnight information, visit https://www.lib.berkeley.edu/hours and pay attention that they are displayed in the form like \u0026lsquo;8 a.m. - 6 a.m.\u0026rsquo;, which means it opens till 6 a.m. next morning. These kinds of information are listed in the details of a library\u0026rsquo;s opening hours details and you need to click on the library to see them, which also makes Python Web Scraper a bit complex to do (so this feature is not integrated here :D). ============================================================ UC Berkeley Library Open Status Last Update: 2026-02-02 02:10:56 PST Data Source: https://www.lib.berkeley.edu/hours ============================================================ Now Open (0)： (None) Now Closed (22)： 🔴 Art History/Classics Library 🔴 Bancroft Library 🔴 Berkeley Law Library 🔴 Bioscience, Natural Resources \u0026amp; Public Health Library 🔴 Business Library 🔴 Chemistry, Astronomy \u0026amp; Physics Library 🔴 Doe Library 🔴 East Asian Library 🔴 Engineering \u0026amp; Mathematical Sciences Library 🔴 Environmental Design Library 🔴 Ethnic Studies Library 🔴 Graduate Services (study only) 🔴 Institute of Governmental Studies Library 🔴 Institute of Transportation Studies Library 🔴 Main (Gardner) Stacks ... and other 7 libraries are closed.

It strips away the distractions of modern casual games, offering a raw, focus-driven environment powered by a robust algorithmic core.\n🎉 v1.0.0 - First Official Release We are thrilled to announce the first stable release of SudoSodoku! This version represents a complete, polished game with all core features implemented and tested:\nProcedural Puzzle Generation: Real-time generation of unique, solvable puzzles. Four Difficulty Levels: Easy, Medium, Hard, and Master with intelligent scoring. Pencil Mode: Toggle candidate notes for complex deduction strategies. Undo/Redo System: Full history stack for fearless experimentation. Smart Archives: Automatic saving with favorites and replay functionality. ELO Rating System: Competitive ranking from SCRIPT_KIDDIE to THE_ARCHITECT. Terminal Aesthetic: Authentic green phosphor UI with haptic feedback. Modular Architecture: Clean, maintainable codebase organized by feature. ✨ Features 🖥️ Immersive Terminal Aesthetic Visuals: Authentic Green Phosphor (#00FF00) on Deep Dark Background (#0D121A). Feedback: \u0026ldquo;Juice\u0026rdquo; interaction model with UIImpactFeedbackGenerator providing mechanical-keyboard-like haptics for every input. Animations: Matrix-style victory effects and CRT-like glow pulses. ♾️ Infinite Procedural Generation Real-time Engine: Generates unique, solvable puzzles on-the-fly using a randomized Backtracking Algorithm. Human-like Grading: Difficulty is not determined by random holes, but by a Logical Solver that simulates human techniques (Naked Singles, Hidden Singles, etc.) to assign a precise difficulty score (0-100). 🏆 Competitive ELO System Dynamic Rating: Starts at 1200 (USER). Beats puzzles to rank up. Adaptive K-Factor: Rating changes stabilize as you reach higher tiers (Master/Grandmaster). Anti-Smurfing: High-level players gain zero rating from solving low-level puzzles. Rank Titles: \u0026lt; 1200: SCRIPT_KIDDIE 1200 - 1400: USER \u0026hellip; 2000+: THE_ARCHITECT 💾 Robust Persistence Game Center Integration: Seamless, password-less login and user profile management. Cloud Sync: Leveraging iCloud Documents to sync game states and archives across devices (automatically degrades to local storage if iCloud is unavailable). JSON Serialization: All game records are stored as Codable JSON structs, ensuring backward compatibility and easy migration. 🛠️ Technical Architecture SudoSodoku is built with modern iOS technologies, designed for maintainability and performance:\nLanguage: Swift 5.9 UI Framework: SwiftUI (Apple\u0026rsquo;s modern declarative UI framework) Architecture: MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern for clean code organization State Management: Reactive updates using Combine framework Data Persistence: Automatic cloud sync via iCloud (with local fallback) Safe file operations with atomic writes Backward-compatible data migration User Experience: Custom animations and haptic feedback for a polished feel Directory Structure SudoSodoku/ ├── Models/ │ ├── GameRecord.swift # Codable save data structure │ ├── SudokuCell.swift # Unit cell model │ ├── MoveHistory.swift # Move history for undo/redo │ └── Difficulty.swift # Enum with rating ranges ├── ViewModels/ │ └── SudokuGame.swift # Core game logic \u0026amp; state machine ├── Managers/ │ ├── GameCenterManager.swift # GameKit authentication │ ├── RatingManager.swift # ELO calculation algorithms │ ├── HapticManager.swift # Haptic feedback engine │ └── StorageManager.swift # File I/O \u0026amp; Cloud syncing ├── Views/ │ ├── ContentView.swift # Main entry \u0026amp; NavigationStack │ ├── LandingView.swift # Landing page │ ├── GameView.swift # The game board │ ├── UserProfileView.swift # User profile \u0026amp; statistics │ ├── ArchiveView.swift # History \u0026amp; Favorites list │ ├── ModeSelectionView.swift # Difficulty selection │ ├── BoardView.swift # Sudoku board rendering │ ├── ControlPanelView.swift # Game controls (undo/redo/numpad) │ ├── Components/ │ │ ├── TerminalBackground.swift # Terminal-style background │ │ ├── MatrixVictoryOverlay.swift # Victory animation │ │ ├── NoteGridView.swift # Note display grid │ │ ├── GridLinesOverlay.swift # Board grid lines │ │ ├── StatCard.swift # Statistics card component │ │ ├── RankRow.swift # Rank display row │ │ └── RecordRow.swift # Archive record row │ └── Styles/ │ └── BouncyButtonStyle.swift # Button animation style └── Algorithms/ └── SudokuGenerator.swift # Backtracking \u0026amp; Digging logic Resources 📂 GitHub Repository:\nhttps://github.com/kaiiiichen/SudoSodoku\n🌱 Latest Release:\n[2026.01.02] SudoSodoku v1.0.0: First Official Release\n📜 Release History:\n[2026.01.02] SudoSodoku v1.0.0: First Official Release [2025.12.22] SudoSodoku v0.5.0 Beta: The Terminal Awakening ","permalink":"https://kai-chen.xyz/projects/sudosodoku/","summary":"A terminal-style Sudoku experience for iOS, designed for logical purists.","title":"SudoSodoku"},{"content":"Last Updated\n2025.12.23\nStatus\nFinished (maintaining).\nNotes ⬇ Download .pdf\nResources ⬇ Download .zip\nRemark\nThis note is part of the SUSTech-Kai-Notes project.\n","permalink":"https://kai-chen.xyz/notes/dsaa/","summary":"Make your first encounter with algorithms\u0026rsquo; design and analysis, and see how clever data structures make magic happen.","title":"Data Structures \u0026 Algorithm Analysis"},{"content":"Last Updated\n2025.12.17\nStatus\nOngoing (close to finish).\nNotes ⬇ Download .pdf\nRemark\nThis note is part of the SUSTech-Kai-Notes project.\n","permalink":"https://kai-chen.xyz/notes/real-analysis/","summary":"Take a dive into Lebesgue\u0026rsquo;s measure theory.","title":"Real Analysis"},{"content":"Last Updated\n2025.12.16\nStatus\nUpdating.\nLaunched in 2025, SUSTech-Kai-Notes is a personal notes initiative motivated by Cambridge Notes. However, one should also lay emphasis on other course resources apart from course notes.\nIt mainly includes the course resources I ever used or collected during my study at SUSTech and also includes few courses I took at other universities, which are mostly for general study credits but worth giving it a try.\nI accompany this special notes project with a Github wiki page, which reviews the project and helps you get directed to submodules within clicks.\nResources 📂 GitHub Repository Wiki:\nhttps://github.com/kaiiiichen/SUSTech-Kai-Notes/wiki ","permalink":"https://kai-chen.xyz/projects/sustech-kai-notes/","summary":"A personal notes initiative.","title":"SUSTech-Kai-Notes"}]
